Subject: [PATCH 204/224] HACK: spi: lpspi: support two chip-selects

At least on i.MX8MM, spi controllers have two native chip-selects.
Initialise the controllers num_chipselect field with 2 accordingly.

This is a hack in that the author is not quite sure if this field should
be set to two for all lpspi controllers, or specific to certain SoCs.
