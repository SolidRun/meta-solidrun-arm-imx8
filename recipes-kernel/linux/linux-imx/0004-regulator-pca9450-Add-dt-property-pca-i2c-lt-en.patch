Subject: [PATCH 04/14] regulator: pca9450: Add dt property pca,i2c-lt-en

The PCA9450 (at least the DS version) has a built in level
translator that allows I2C lines to be shifted from 3.3V to 1.8V.
This is not a regulator, or a gate just a level shifter that can
be configured to be enabled in various run modes.  It is more of
a power management feature for the PMIC.  By default this is
disabled which means unless the firmware enabled the level
translator there is no communication possible with the devices
on the I2C bus.

Rather than doing a bunch of fancy work to make this work as a
regulator...because it isn't...we just add a property so this
function of the PMIC can be configured properly at probe time.
